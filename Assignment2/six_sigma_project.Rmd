# Background

PhoneNow is a small technology company, especially known for producing high quality phones at a low cost. Their business strategy is based on selling large quantities of good quality phones to the low-end market. In this way the avoid the large market shares of Apple and Samsung in the luxury phone market. Their main competitors are Xiaomi, Nokia and Moto, among others. Moreover, they only sell products directly from their own website, and the products are made on-demand. This way, their business does not require very large amounts of capital at all times, since they use capital they get directly from each customer for their costs. Also, they guarantee a production (and delivery) time of maximum one month, i.e. the customer should have their phone in their hand within one month. If this guarantee is not fulfilled, the customer receives a 10\% discount. Furthermore, if the phone is not to the quality that the customer expects, PhoneNow will make a new phone for the respective customer. 

Their business has been very successful the last couple of years, with the market shares growing. However, the last two months they have received much larger amounts of complaints on production time and quality of their products. This is why the Six-Sigma will be employed, with the goal of resolving some of the issues. The initial project was to reduce the number of complaints from the customers, both when it comes to production time and quality of the products. 

The Steering Committee estimated that the percentage of unsatisfied customers because of long production time with lower quality than expected was between 10\% and 15\%. A maximum level equal to 3\% was deemed as acceptable.

A team of 2 managers was launched, led by a Black Belt (BB), formed in the UPC.

## Business Case
The annual turnover of PhoneNow is 100,000 â‚¬.

The 15\% of delayed production with 10% of discounts supposes a cost of ????

**Also: what about the cost of the people that get a bad quality phone!?**

Estimation has been validated by the finance director.


### Order to Delivery
We divide this process into 1) order to shipment and 2) shipment to delivery. The company only has 1) completely under control whereas 2) is given to another company.

```{r}
N=1000
# time from customer ordering to phone being ready for shipment
t_to_ship = rexp(N,1/7) + rnorm(N,7,2)

#more shipment two companies are used. maybe there's a difference
t_ship_comp1 = rexp(N/2,1/2) + rnorm(N/2,0.5,0.2)
t_ship_comp2 = rexp(N/2,1/2.5) + rnorm(N/2,0.5,0.01)

total_time = t_to_ship + c(t_ship_comp1,t_ship_comp2) # company1 shipped the 1st half of phones, comp2 the 2nd

hist(total_time,main="Time from order to delivery", xlab="Days", col=4)
```

Let's compare both shipment companies to see if we should prefer one over the other.

```{r}
wilcox.test(t_ship_comp1,t_ship_comp2)
median(t_ship_comp1) < median(t_ship_comp2)
```


In fact there is a significant difference between the delivery time of both companies. If possible, commissioning the first should be preferred.


### Quality of Phones by 3x2 different Material Suppliers

The company receives the glass either from the company "Gorilla Glass", "Special Glass" or "Simple Glass" and also the touch screen technology is ordered from two different suppliers "1" and "2".

```{r}
# first simulate latent quality variables
q_gorilla = rnorm(N,0.8,0.2)
q_special = rnorm(N,0.85,0.1)
q_simple  = rnorm(N,0.77,0.3)


q_touch1 = rnorm(0.9,0.11)
q_touch2 = rnorm(0.8,0.25)

for (v in c(q_gorilla,q_special,q_simple, q_touch1, q_touch2)){
  if (v < 0) v=0
  if (v>1) v=1
}

#init
phones_working = vector('numeric',6) 
M = 150 #each of the 6 cells gets 150 datapoints

for (i in 1:6){
  phones_working = sum( rbinom(M,1,q_touch1[1:M]) * rbinom(M,1,q_gorilla[1:M]))
}

## produces NaNs bc for loop wasn't executed as intented
#
```

```{r}
# maybe easier way to produce the data
pw_11 = rbinom(M,1,0.99)
pw_12 = rbinom(M,1,0.98)
pw_21 = rbinom(M,1,0.95)
pw_22 = rbinom(M,1,0.96)
pw_31 = rbinom(M,1,0.92)
pw_32 = rbinom(M,1,0.93)
```

## Questions to answer

## Review existing data and validate the measurement system

## Control Chart


## Collect new data after the proposed improvements
